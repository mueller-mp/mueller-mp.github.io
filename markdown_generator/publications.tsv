2023-06-01	In or Out? Fixing ImageNet Out-of-distribution detection	ICML	We show that previously used datasets for evaluating OOD detection on ImageNet are severly flawed, because they contain a significant fraction of ID samples. We present NINCO, a novel hand-cleaned dataset as a solution.	J. Bitterwolf*, M. Müller* and Matthias Hein (*equal contribution) (2023) “In or out?

2023-02-14	A modern look at the relationship between sharpness and generaliization	ICML	In a large-scale study we observe that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization but rather with some training parameters.

2023-06-07	Normalization Layers Are All That Sharpness-Aware Minimization Needs	NeurIPS	We show that perturbing only the affine normalization parameters (roughly 0.1% of all parameters) in the adversarial step of SAM typically outperforms perturbing all of the parameters. This finding generalizes to different SAM variants and both BatchNorm and LayerNorm. Alternative sparse perturbation approaches do not achieve similar performance, especially not at such extreme sparsity levels.

2022-05-02	Leveraging Stochastic Predictions of Bayesian Neural Networks for Fluid Simulations	NeurIPS	We investigate uncertainty estimation and multimodality via the non-deterministic predictions of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) in fluid simulations. To this end, we deploy BNNs in three challenging experimental test-cases of increasing complexity.

2018-12-10	Fast evaluation of the current driven by electron cyclotron waves for reactor studies	Physics of Plasmas	In this paper, a procedure for the evaluation of the optimum current driven by EC waves for given global parameters is proposed, which relies on a single numerical calculation of the current drive efficiency, based on the adjoint method (including momentum-conserving corrections).
