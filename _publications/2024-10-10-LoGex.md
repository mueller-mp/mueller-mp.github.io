excerpt: 'In realistic medical settings, the data are often inherently long-tailed, with most samples concentrated in a few classes and a long
tail of rare classes, usually containing just a few samples. This distribution presents a significant challenge because rare conditions are critical to detect and difficult to classify due to limited data. In this paper, rather than attempting to classify rare classes, we aim to detect these as out-of-distribution data reliably. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem. We significantly improve the OOD detection performance on a challenging histopathological task with only ten samples per tail class without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.'

VisionTransformers have been shown to be powerful out-of-distribution detectors for ImageNet-scale settings when finetuned from publicly available checkpoints, often outperforming other model types on popular benchmarks. In this work, we investigate the impact of both the pretraining and finetuning scheme on the performance of ViTs on this task by analyzing a large pool of models. We find that the exact type of pretraining has a strong impact on which method works well and on OOD detection performance in general. We further show that certain training schemes might only be effective for a specific type of out-distribution, but not in general, and identify a best-practice training recipe.
