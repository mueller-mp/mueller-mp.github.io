excerpt: 'We investigate the impact of both the pretraining and finetuning scheme on the performance of ViTs on ImageNet-scale OOD detection by analyzing a large pool of models. We find that the exact type of pretraining has a strong impact on which method works well and on OOD detection performance in general.'

We investigate the impact of both the pretraining and finetuning scheme on the performance of ViTs on ImageNet-scale OOD detection by analyzing a large pool of models. We find that the exact type of pretraining has a strong impact on which method works well and on OOD detection performance in general.
