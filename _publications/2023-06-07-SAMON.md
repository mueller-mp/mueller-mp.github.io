excerpt: 'We show that perturbing only the affine normalization parameters (roughly 0.1% of all parameters) in the adversarial step of SAM typically outperforms perturbing all of the parameters. This finding generalizes to different SAM variants and both BatchNorm and LayerNorm. Alternative sparse perturbation approaches do not achieve similar performance, especially not at such extreme sparsity levels.'

We show that perturbing only the affine normalization parameters (roughly 0.1% of all parameters) in the adversarial step of SAM typically outperforms perturbing all of the parameters. This finding generalizes to different SAM variants and both BatchNorm and LayerNorm. Alternative sparse perturbation approaches do not achieve similar performance, especially not at such extreme sparsity levels.
